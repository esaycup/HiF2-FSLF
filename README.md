# HiF2-FSLF
We attempt to classify an HSI scene with only a few samples with the help of a similar scene with a large sample size of both HSI and LiDAR, and propose a few-shot learning (FSL) framework based dual-source hierarchical frequency domain fusion for HSI and LiDAR classification (HiF2-FSLF).
